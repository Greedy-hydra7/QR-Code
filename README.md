## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to use Flexbox to center elements both horizontally and vertically. Here is an example of the CSS I used:

```css
.attribution {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}

Continued development
In future projects, I want to continue improving my skills in responsive design and explore more advanced CSS techniques.

Useful resources
